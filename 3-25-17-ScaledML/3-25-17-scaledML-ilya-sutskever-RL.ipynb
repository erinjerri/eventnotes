    "# Ilya Sutskever (Research Director + Co-Founder at OpenAI) Evolution Strategies: a scalable alternative to reinforcement learning.\n",
    "* Tim Salimans, Jonathan Ho, Peter Chen, Ilya Sutskever\n",
    "\n",
    "###\n",
    "*OpenAI's mission is to build safe AGI, and ensure AGI's benefits are as widely and evenly distributed as possible. \n",
    "* Non-profit of 60 dedicated to working towards our mission regardless of oppprotunies ...\n",
    "* Focus on LT reserach, working at forefront of field, . The best way to predict the future is to invent it. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning algorithms that work\n",
    "* Supervised back propogation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reinforcement Learning (RL) \n",
    "* RL is the right problem\n",
    "* Do we have excellent RL algorithms?\n",
    "* action -> world -> observation\n",
    "* How to build an agent in a complex environment and accomplishes its goals\n",
    "* RL algos can train agents on games and robos, which is really exciting\n",
    "* Super good RL algo brings us closer to AGI\n",
    "* There exist Rl reasonably general RL algos\n",
    "* ex. Raw Pixels => Hidden Layer => probably of up down sway\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evolution strategies\n",
    "* Simplest algorithm\n",
    "* Add noise to the parameters\n",
    "* If the result improves, keep the change\n",
    "* Repeat \n",
    "* Neural networks have M of params\n",
    "* there's no chance for this kind of random hillclimbing to succeed\n",
    "\n",
    "### Surprise\n",
    "* Counterintuitive\n",
    "* Evolution strategies is competitive w/ todays' RL algorithms on standard benchmarks \n",
    "* Evolution stategies randomized finite diffs perbut\n",
    "* Key contributions\n",
    "    * Show the algo is competitive w/ today's existint RL algo's\n",
    "    * Show that it pralellizes extremely well \n",
    "\n",
    "### Paralellization\n",
    "* Hella workers, gradient descent, workers need to share big vectors\n",
    "* Each worker broadasts tiny scalars not vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distributed Evolution Strategies\n",
    "* Quant results on the Humaniod Mujoco task\n",
    "\n",
    "### Competing RL algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "* A3 Mnih et al 2016\n",
    "* Trust Region Poicy Optimization (TRPO) 2016\n",
    "\n",
    "## Details of Results\n",
    "* Match 1 day A3C on Atari games on avg (better 50%, worse on 50 of games) in 1 hour of distributed implementation w/ 720 cores\n",
    "* We need 3x-10x more data\n",
    "* No backward pass, no need to store activations in memory\n",
    "\n",
    "### MuJoCo results\n",
    "* Es needs more data, but achieves nearly the same result\n",
    "* If we use 1440 cores, we need 10 mins to solve the humanoid task, which takes 1 day w/ TRPO ona single machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Long Horizons\n",
    "* Long horizons are hard for RL.\n",
    "* RL is senstive to action frequency. \n",
    "* High freq of actions makes the RL problem more difficult.\n",
    "* Not so for Evolution Strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's going on\n",
    "* Fact: speed of Evolution Strategies dpends on the intrinsic dimensionality of hte probelm not on the actual dimensionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Infographic\n",
    "* Loss \n",
    "* Relevant parameters to irrelevant parameters \n",
    "* Svolution strategies doesn't care about irrelevant parameters \n",
    "* Evolution Strategies automatically discards the irrelevant dimensions - even when they live on complicated subspace\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evolution Stragies and Supervised Learning\n",
    "* RL is slow\n",
    "* RL gradients are very noisy\n",
    "* This fact helps ES to be competitive w/ RL\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supervised Learning\n",
    "* Work in prog, but often 1000x slower\n",
    "* Can solve MNIST overnight on a single GPU\n",
    "* Solving CIFAR-10 takes days\n",
    "\n",
    "### Backprop vs Evolution Strategies\n",
    "* ES does not use backprop\n",
    "* So scale of initialization, vashing gradients, etc are not important\n",
    "\n",
    "### Estimates gradient\n",
    "* If gradient is bad, ES will give you bad answer and noisy, won't be good\n",
    "* Counterntuitive result: every trick that heps backrpop, also helps evolution strategies\n",
    "* Scale of random init, batch norm, REsnet\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "* Evolution strategies works\n",
    "* Do not shy away from policy gradient on high dimensional spaces, it too is likely to work very well\n"
